flask+reco+combus


makes sure the index.html is in a sub-floder called templates

do not change the name "application.py" if not flask wont work (idky soo just do it, dont ask)

please add all combustible object names into the combustiblelist.csv file 


the output will be something like this [[plant,wood],[metal]]
it is two list in a list -> [ combustible_list , noncombustible_list ]


html is just for me(ben) to test if the flask is working

if u want to see the pic after uploading it, just type /display/"ur pic name put here " after the link 
e.g. -> if your link at first is http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and the pic file name is cat.png then just put http://127.0.0.1:5000/display/cat.png
